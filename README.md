# TestRandomMonad

This is a simple test-implementation of a 'RandomMonad' typeclass. An implementation of this typeclass for the 'StateT' monad tranformer has been provided. The repository also conains test implementations of the reader monad, called 'ReaderM', and the state monad called 'StateM'

This has been written purely as a learning experience. As such the code is poorly tested, not maintained and by no means meant to be used in real applications. If a random monad is needed, real implementations can be found on hackage.
